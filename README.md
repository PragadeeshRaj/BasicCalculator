# Basic Four Function Calculator
* This is the four function calculator that will eventually make its way into website integration.
* As of right now, unfortunately, all our website integrations
must be linked to another platform. This is extremely 
inconvenient for the user so python console integration into 
our website is coming shortly.
* More calculators are soon to come, stay tuned!

## Caluclator Use
* When prompted after running the code, please choose an operation.
* You may choose '+', '-', '*', or '/'
* These operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division respectively.
* Then, please enter your first and second number when prompted
and get a calculation. 
* You may choose to do another calculation or exit out of the code.
